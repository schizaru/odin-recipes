    <h3>Preparation steps:</h3>

    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      lasagna:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the enchanted cauldron, combine sweet Italian sausage and lean
            ground beef with onion and garlic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduce crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste,
            capturing the essence of divine flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle in sugar and add a magical blend of spices — fresh parsley,
            dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black
            pepper. Allow this mixture to simmer under the dragon's breath until
            flavors meld.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Lasagna Layers:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Layer enchanted lasagna noodles in a grand golden vessel, starting
            with the celestial meat sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apply a layer of ricotta, mixed with the binding magic of an egg,
            ensuring a heavenly structure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Final Enchantment:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Shower the layers with a trio of cheeses — Parmesan, mozzarella, and
            ricotta — creating a divine fusion of decadent flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Envelop the lasagna in the mystical foil cover and place it into the
            oven, preheated by the dragon's fiery breath.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Worship the Greatness of Asgard:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After a sacred baking, unveil the lasagna and let it rest, allowing
            all the magic within to unfold.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
